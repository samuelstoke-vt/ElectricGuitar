## Project Overview

For this project we will create a fully functioning electric guitar. We will capture string vibrations and convert them to electrical signals and then process them into real-time sound effects. Additionally, we will have an LED design which will light up with brightness proportional to the guitar's sound intensity.

## Educational Value Added

There is a lot of circuitry involved in this project for both the sound and light components. Also, the signal processing and sound production will require a fair amount of mathematics and programming.
